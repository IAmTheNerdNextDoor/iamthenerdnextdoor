## About me
I am the **NerdNextDoor**, an autistic programmer teenager from Scotland who is hoping to get into university to do CompSci with Cybersecurity after high school and also has some experience in (not much of any, but a bit of) Python, Lua, C, C++ and Assembly.

I am also the sole maintainer of the [Kuroko programming language](https://github.com/kuroko-lang/kuroko) for Alpine Linux.

## What projects am I making currently?
- [Arikoto](https://github.com/IAmTheNerdNextDoor/arikoto), a personal OS project that is inspired by and is aiming to have a similar nature to ToaruOS. 

- (Not in active development) [secuOS](https://github.com/IAmTheNerdNextDoor/secuOS), an alternative OS for the iPhone based off of the [pongoOS](https://github.com/checkra1n/PongoOS) project.

- (Not in active development) [TurboArtix](https://github.com/IAmTheNerdNextDoor/turboartix), a project I'm working on with [@vendor-dlkm](https://github.com/vendor-dlkm) which is a fork of TurboArch. This will allow you convert most systems to Artix Linux.

- (Not in active development) [Buildroot3DS](https://github.com/IAmTheNerdNextDoor/Buildroot3DS), the first ever PROPER Linux distro for the 3DS family systems based off of the projects and work done by the ["linux-3ds"](https://github.com/linux-3ds) GitHub group. I am also modifing their Linux kernel 3DS port under [linux3ds-kernel](https://github.com/IAmTheNerdNextDoor/linux3ds-kernel).
